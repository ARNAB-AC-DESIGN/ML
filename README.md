# Plant Disease Prediction (Machine Learning/AI - ML)

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting plant diseases using deep learning techniques. The notebook `plant_disease_pred.ipynb` contains the implementation of a model that classifies different plant diseases based on image inputs.

## Features
- Image-based disease classification
- Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Preprocessing of input images
- Model training, validation, and evaluation
- Visualization of training performance

## Requirements
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opencv-python
```

## Dataset
The model requires a dataset of plant disease images. Ensure you have a properly labeled dataset structured in a way that suits image classification tasks. The dataset should be split into training, validation, and test sets.

## How to Use
1. Open the `plant_disease_pred.ipynb` notebook.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess the images.
3. Train the CNN model using the provided code.
4. Evaluate the model's performance on test data.
5. Use the trained model for prediction.

## Model Architecture
- Input Layer: Processes image data
- Convolutional Layers: Extracts important features
- Pooling Layers: Reduces dimensionality
- Fully Connected Layers: Classifies the disease
- Output Layer: Softmax activation for multi-class classification

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, loss, precision, and recall. Visualization plots are included to track training progress.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance dataset quality and size
- Implement transfer learning for better accuracy
- Optimize hyperparameters for improved performance
- Deploy the model as a web or mobile application
