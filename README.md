# K-Means Clustering Basics (MACHINE LEARNING/AI -ML)

## Overview
This project explores the fundamentals of K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for grouping similar data points into clusters. The notebook `K-MEANS_BASICS.ipynb` provides an implementation of K-Means on a sample dataset.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and normalizes data
- **K-Means Clustering**: Applies the algorithm to find meaningful clusters
- **Elbow Method**: Determines the optimal number of clusters
- **Visualization**: Uses plots to interpret clustering results

## Requirements
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset
This notebook can be used with any dataset suitable for clustering. Ensure the dataset is cleaned and standardized before applying K-Means.

## How to Use
1. Open the `K-MEANS_BASICS.ipynb` notebook.
2. Load and preprocess the dataset.
3. Apply the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. Train and visualize the K-Means clustering results.
5. Analyze cluster distributions and their characteristics.

## Model Workflow
- **Step 1**: Load and preprocess data
- **Step 2**: Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
- **Step 3**: Apply K-Means clustering
- **Step 4**: Visualize and interpret results

## Results
The notebook provides insights into how K-Means groups data into clusters. Visualization techniques, such as scatter plots and cluster boundaries, help interpret the model's performance.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different distance metrics (e.g., Manhattan distance)
- Implement **Hierarchical Clustering** for comparison
- Optimize the model using **Silhouette Analysis**
- Deploy as an interactive clustering tool
